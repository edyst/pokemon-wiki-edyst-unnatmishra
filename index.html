      <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
      <p>
          Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of 
          the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in 
          Japan for the Game Boy,and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their 
                        developers.
                        
                  Let us know some pokemon types.

          <div class="flex-item ">
              Water is one of the three basic  elemental types 
              along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three 
              starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type 
              concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
               which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                  concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so 
                  choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

              <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
                   out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves.
                    A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

              <ul>
                  <li id="li-1">We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for 
                  every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger 
                  evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a 
                  question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>  
                  <li id="li-2">Answer is Raichu</li>
              </ul>
              <li><h4>2. What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</h4></li>
              <ul>
                <li id="li-1">Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up
                   with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented 
                   with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>

          The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
          created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
          Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
          after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
          Green version was not released outside Japan

  generation, an enhanced version, titled Pokémon Crystal, was later

            Pokémon entered its third generation with the 2002 release
            of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire for Game Boy Advance and continued
            with the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokémon Red and Green,
            Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen (Red and Green representing the
            original Japanese first generation games; territories outside
            Japan instead saw releases of Red and Blue). An enhanced remake of
            Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokémon Emerald followed after.
